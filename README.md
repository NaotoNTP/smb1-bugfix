	SMBDIS.ASM - A COMPREHENSIVE SUPER MARIO BROS. DISASSEMBLY
	by doppelganger (doppelheathen@gmail.com)

	This file is provided for your own use as-is.  It will require the character rom data
	and an iNES file header to get it to work.

	There are so many people I have to thank for this, that taking all the credit for
	myself would be an unforgivable act of arrogance. Without their help this would
	probably not be possible.  So I thank all the peeps in the nesdev scene whose insight into
	the 6502 and the NES helped me learn how it works (you guys know who you are, there's no 
	way I could have done this without your help), as well as the authors of x816 and SMB 
	Utility, and the reverse-engineers who did the original Super Mario Bros. Hacking Project, 
	which I compared notes with but did not copy from.  Last but certainly not least, I thank
	Nintendo for creating this game and the NES, without which this disassembly would
	only be theory.

	Assembles with x816.
